/**
 * An implementation of the path generation library originally witten by
 * Xavier Guzman.
 *
 * <p>
 * Although this is a relatively efficient pathfinder, and one that's more than
 * capable of performing exactly as expected, this pathfinder can sometimes
 * generate paths with way too many points. As a result, certain types of
 * followers will be incredibly slow to follow the path.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This is really where a lot of the "magic" happens. Although Pathfinder on
 * its own handles a lot of stuff - positional tracking, multithreading,
 * path management, path generation, path following, all of that cool stuff -
 * most of the actual path generation is outsourced to another library.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * As a result, the code in this class is all tested and working extremely
 * well. Any issues with path generation that can't be resolved by opening
 * an issue on Pathfinder should be reported. As Xavier's library is hosted
 * and built on my GitHub, I can make any changes that would fix the code.
 * </p>
