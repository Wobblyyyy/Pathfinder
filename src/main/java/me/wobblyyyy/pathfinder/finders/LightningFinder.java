/**
 * The fastest pathfinder available. Or something like that.
 *
 * <p>
 * This generator works by checking to see if the area in question of the
 * field is empty or not. If the area is empty, this returns the start and
 * the end points in an array. If the area is not empty, this returns an
 * empty array, signifying that the next path generator in the queue
 * should try to find a path instead.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When looking at performance analysis, we can see that the average execution
 * time for the calculation of a given path is reduced dramatically when using
 * this type of finder over another type, such as the Speed or the Xygum finder.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Average Lightning: 5ms</li>
 *     <li>Average Speed: 7ms</li>
 *     <li>Average Xygum: 20-133ms (depends on size)</li>
