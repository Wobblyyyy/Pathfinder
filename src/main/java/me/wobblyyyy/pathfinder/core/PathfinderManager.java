 * A manager, designed for interacting with the whole of Pathfinder.
 *
 * <p>
 * Unlike the more refined Pathfinder, this class is filled with all sorts
 * of different methods for all sorts of different purposes. Unless you have
 * a pretty strong reason to be working directly with the manager, it's most
 * certainly a better idea to stick to the most abstract form of Pathfinder
 * that you can possibly get to.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * With that being said, however, you can still feel free to do whatever you'd
 * like here - I'm not gonna stop you. All of the public-facing methods in this
 * class are fairly well-documented, so I'd suggest you read that documentation
 * before trying something pointless.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Best of luck in your pathfinding adventures!
