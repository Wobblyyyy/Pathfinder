 * Unlike the more refined Pathfinder, this class is filled with all sorts
 * of different methods for all sorts of different purposes. Unless you have
 * a pretty strong reason to be working directly with the manager, it's most
 * certainly a better idea to stick to the most abstract form of Pathfinder
 * that you can possibly get to.

 *
 * <p>
 * With that being said, however, you can still feel free to do whatever you'd
 * like here - I'm not gonna stop you. All of the public-facing methods in this

 * before trying something pointless.
