/**
 * A partially uncompleted (or partially completed) pathfinder state.
 *
 * <p>
 * PromisedFinder as a class doesn't actually do very much. However, the
 * purpose of PromisedFinder is to allow you to easily write what are in
 * essence "callbacks" upon the path generation's termination.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, if you'd like to run a piece of code after the pathfinder
 * has tried (and failed) to generate a path, you could make use of the
 * {@link PromisedFinder#fail(Runnable)} method.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * As a more contextualized example, take:
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * Pathfinder pathfinder;
 *
 * pathfinder.followPath([path]).after(() -> {
 *    // Code to be executed after the pathfinder finishes
 *    // path generation and finding.
 * }).pass(() -> {
 *     // Code to be executed after the pathfinder successfully
 *     // generates a path.
 * }).fail(() -> {
 *     // Code to be executed after the pathfinder doesn't manage
 *     // to generate a path.
 * });
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link PromisedFinder} objects are also capable of providing information
 * about the status of path generation. If, for example, you'd like to execute
 * some code after the pathfinder's execution, but you need to get the path
 * that was just generated, you can use the method
 * {@link PromisedFinder#getPath()} to do exactly that.
 * </p>
