/**
 * The highest-level Pathfinder available.
 *
 * <p>
 * As an abstraction, this class provides everything you'd possibly need to
 * get started with finding paths and conquering noobs. Operation is fairly
 * simple - if you're not following a tutorial on what's going on right now,
 * you might want to go check one out.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Documentation is always available online - check out Pathfinder's GitHub
 * repository if you're confused about where to find it. From there, you can
 * learn about all kinds of very wonderful and very cool topics.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Although this class is designed to be as incredibly simple as possible,
 * there's a ton of customizable features behind Pathfinder. In order to
 * customize these features, and, actually, in order to instantiate a new
 * Pathfinder, you'll need to read up on all of the different options available
 * in the {@link PathfinderConfig} class.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class, as a result of its high level of abstraction, is little more
 * than a wrapper class with more user-friendly documentation. Anything that
 * you'd like to accomplish but can't with this class can likely be
 * accomplished by using the {@link PathfinderManager} class, which contains
 * many more methods and bits of functionality that you can make use of.
 * </p>
