/**
 * Circles, much like rectangles, and literally any other shape, are...
 * cool? Maybe?
 *
 * <p>
 * Circles are a lot more complex mathematically than their linear
 * counterparts. I'm writing a lot of code that doesn't really do much
 * right now and I'm not near any pencils and paper so I don't feel like
 * working out the math to figure out how to detect things like line-circle
 * collisions and even circle-circle collisions, but I'm sure I'll get
 * around to that somewhere in the near enough future.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you'll notice, this circle actually has two component circles contained
 * within it - one labelled "circle," and the other; "hitbox." My reasoning
 * behind doing this has nothing to do with liking to type out GigaArc (GigaArc
 * GigaArc GigaArc GigaArc GigaArc GigaArc) and more to do with the fact that
 * circles are a tad bit finicky and I have a feeling the hitbox might
 * come in handy for future collision detection (and hopefully avoidance).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that circles are a lot less expensive than rectangles and they have
 * significantly fewer components. If you have a situation in which a circle
 * could serve as a substitute for a rectangle...
 * </p>
