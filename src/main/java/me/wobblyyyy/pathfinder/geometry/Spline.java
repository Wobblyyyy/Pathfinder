/**
 * Ahh... splines. Basically gay lines. I swear I'm not homophobic, I like men
 * too. Anyways. Straight lines are very linear and very boring. Splines, on
 * the other hand, are basically straight lines that aren't at all straight -
 * rather, they curve. Splines are incredibly useful in making complex movement
 * trajectories and profiles. Unlike regular lines, splines, as you know, have
 * an element of curvature. This element of curvature allows for your robot to
 * continually move without ever having to come to a stop or a hard direction
 * change. Splines themselves are representations of a concept, not fully
 * fledged implementations of a trajectory following algorithm.
 *
 * <p>
 * Splines, or at least these splines, make use of the Fritsch-Carlson method
 * for computing internal spline parameters. This method isn't incredibly
 * computationally expensive, but as a best practice, it's suggested that you
 * do as little runtime execution of spline initialization.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Interpolation is handled by yet another rather complex algorithm that nobody
 * quite understands - including me, probably. Anyways, if you really are quite
 * sincerely interested in learning how spline interpolation works, you can
 * go check out the {@link SplineInterpolator} class - that has all the cool
 * and sexy math you might want to look at.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * It's certainly worth noting that splines don't form perfect arcs. If you'd
 * like to create an arc that is as perfect as you can get, the spline class
 * isn't the class for you. As of writing, there are no classes to do exactly
 * that, but I'm planning on creating one within the next day. Check out the
 * trajectory package for something that has to do with circles if you'd like
 * to pursue that oh-so-perfect arc.
 * </p>
