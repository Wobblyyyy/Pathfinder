/**
 * The most basic of the geometric shapes used in

 *
 * <p>
 * Just as a quick notice: this code is really old. Like, really old. As in at
 * least 6 months, which is quite old for a new project. Anyways. If you find
 * yourself looking at this comment right here and you'd like to make this
 * code better, be my guest.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The four lines; top, right, bottom, and left, are
 * used for collision detection. Mostly everything else
 * in this class is fairly useless.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following words are used frequently throughout this class.
 * Some of those words have the same meaning.
 * <uL>
 * <li>TOP (or FRONT)</li>
 * <li>RIGHT</li>
 * <li>BOTTOM (or BACK)</li>
 * <li>LEFT</li>
 * </uL>
 * In case you have not yet noticed, all of these words are relative
 * words - meaning that they're relative to whatever angle the rectangle
 * is being viewed at. Rather than further complicating the way in which
 * this library's geometry system works, I decided to stick with (quite
 * simple) relative words. This does mean, however, that you'll need to
 * keep track of which side is which somehow. I don't care how you do it,
 * or if you even do it at all - but it might be at least a little bit
 * helpful to have/do.
