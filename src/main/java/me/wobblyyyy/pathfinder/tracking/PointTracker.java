/**
 * Track a single point in a two-dimensional environment.
 *
 * <p>
 * All of the math behind this is fairly easy to find - however, as a
 * very quick overview...
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The movement of a single point can be expressed as follows.
 * <pre>
 * M_xyz = T_x + T_y + R_z
 * </pre>
 * where...
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         x is the horizontal component of the X/Y plane.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         y is the vertical component of the X/Y plane.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         z is a measure of rotation or direction.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         M is a representation of the point's movement, which is a
 *         combination of the point's (a) X and Y translation and (b)
 *         rotation or direction.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         T is a measure of the point's translational movement along
 *         a given axis.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         R is a measure of the point's rotational movement.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Thus, the X and Y coordinates can be tracked as follows.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>x_n = x_o * M_xy(cos(theta))</li>
 *     <li>y_n = y_o * M_xy(sin(theta))</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
