     * @param odometry      the odometry subsystem that's used by the pathfinder
     *                      in determining the robot's position. This odometry
     *                      system should be as accurate as possible and maintain
     *                      contact with the ground at all times.
     * @param fieldWidth    the fieldWidth of the field, in whatever units you'd like.
     *                      Although the units don't matter much, you need to be
     *                      sure to keep the units consistent.
     * @param fieldHeight   the fieldHeight of the field, in whatever units you'd like.
     *                      Although the units don't matter much, you need to be
     *                      sure to keep the units consistent.
     * @param robotX        the robot's X dimension. X/Y are the same thing here.
     *                      That's not to say that you shouldn't measure X and Y
     *                      values - accuracy is still just as important as ever.
     * @param robotY        the robot's Y dimension. X/Y are the same thing here.
     *                      That's not to say that you shouldn't measure X and Y
     *                      values - accuracy is still just as important as ever.
     * @param gapX          the distance (in inches) between the pair of front
     *                      right and front left wheel centers.
     * @param gapY          the distance (in inches) between the pair of front
     *                      right and back right wheel centers.
     * @param profile       the robot's motion profiling profile. This profile
     *                      should provide (at least somewhat accurate) info
     *                      on the robot's motion in real life.
     * @param drive         the robot's drivetrain. The drivetrain is (rather
     *                      obviously) used to actually drive the robot.
     * @param map           a virtual map of something. In most cases, this is
     *                      a game field with all your different obstacles and
     *                      what not.
     * @param follower      what type of follower the pathfinder uses.
     * @param speed         the speed that linear followers should run at.
