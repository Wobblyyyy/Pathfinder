/**
 * The most incredibly simple trajectory follower you could possible imagine.
 * This follower works by linearly driving the drivetrain in a given direction.
 * The follower's speed coefficient (how fast the robot moves out of a possible
 * 100% power) can be modified on construction, allowing the follower to be
 * either faster or slower. After the follower's execution has finished
 * entirely, the follower should stop the robot by setting power to each of the
 * drivetrain's motors to 0. Please note that this follower doesn't have any
 * dynamic correction - if the robot is in the wrong place, the follower won't
 * work, and your pathfinder will have a hard time... pathfinding.
