/**
 * One of the more primitive types of path following systems.
 *
 * <p>
 * Due to my lack of experience with any form of math that a 3rd grader
 * couldn't handle with ease, this thing's a little bit broken as of now.
 * Shorter paths - paths that don't allow the robot to fully accelerate and
 * decelerate - are run linearly with a slower speed coefficient. This needs
 * to be addressed in the near future if this is to be a viable pathfinding
 * follower, but I don't know what to do as of now.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * As with all other types of followers, this should be instantiated for each
 * trajectory the robot is supposed to follow.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Follow a path based on optimal acceleration and deceleration rates. These
 * values should be calculated with some form of utility and are best notated
 * as...
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Time (seconds) to go from a stop to max speed.</li>
 *     <li>Time (seconds) to go from max speed to a stop.</li>
 *     <li>Distance (inches) that the robot travels to accelerate.</li>
 *     <li>Distance (inches) that the robot travels to decelerate.</li>
 *     <li>The robot's maximum speed (feet per second).</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If any of these values are inaccurate, the robot's pathfinding ability
 * will be hindered significantly. The more accurate these values are, the
 * more efficient the following system will be.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Although the name would, in fact, suggest that this is a proportional
 * integral derivative follower, this is only mostly a proportional integral
 * derivative follower. Proportional is the most important part here - the
 * robot's power is (almost) directly proportional to how far from the target
 * the robot is.
 * </p>
