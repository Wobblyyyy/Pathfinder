# Examples
The "Examples" section of this repository is designed to provide mostly-functional
implementations of some of the core concepts provided in Pathfinder. Each of the
examples contains a README file that explains more about the example and what you
need to know about it.

## Documentation
These examples are NOT designed to replace the documentation Pathfinder has. Although
these examples do explain some of the key ideas in Pathfinder, these examples DO NOT
document anywhere near as much as the official documentation.
