# Examples
The "Examples" section of this repository is designed to provide mostly-functional
implementations of some of the core concepts provided in Pathfinder. Each of the
examples contains a README file that explains more about the example and what you
need to know about it.

## Explanations
Each example has a corresponding video guide that covers how the example was put
together. These video guides are not well-edited masterpieces that cover exactly
what you want to know and why - they're recordings of the work that goes into
utilizing Pathfinder. I'm not an expert programmer, I make mistakes, and I'll make
mistakes in the video guides. The finished product will always be available in the
example directory, but the work that goes into it will be available in the video.

## Documentation
These examples are NOT designed to replace the documentation Pathfinder has. Although
these examples do explain some of the key ideas in Pathfinder, these examples DO NOT
document anywhere near as much as the official documentation.
